# Overview and Goals

## Alcohol Lapse Prediction

-   Developed an XGBoost machine learning model to predict alcohol lapses in the next 24 hours using ecological momentary assessments (EMA; Wyant et al., 2023)
-   Model has exceptional performance when predicting lapses for new individuals (mean auROC = .90)
-   Locally important features can identify the factors that contribute to lapse risk for any specific person and moment in time
-   A "smart" digital therapeutic (smart DTx) could use algorithms based on this model to monitor lapse risk and recommend personalized, optimal interventions and supports for momentary risks


## Algorithmic Fairness

-   Less privileged, marginalized groups display mental health treatment disparities due to barriers related to affordability, accessibility, availability, and acceptability of mental healthcare
-   Smart DTx can partially address these barriers by providing 24/7/365, affordable, personalized support
-   However, if embedded algorithms perform relatively worse for less privileged groups, their use may exacerbate rather than reduce treatment disparities
\

### GOAL: Evaluate algorithmic fairness across historically
\

### privileged and unprivileged groups

# Conclusions

## Summary

-   Substantially poorer model performance for people of color
-   Modestly poorer model performance for groups defined by sex, income, and age
-   Representation in training data is clearly important
-   Poorer performance for some unprivileged groups may also result from selection of features using domain expertise based on decades of research focused on predominately white men


## Next Steps

-   Evaluate methods to reduce algorithmic bias
    -   More representative training data (NIDA project)
    -   Resampling to increase representation
    -   Modified cost functions to differential penalize errors based on privilege
    -   Control for privilege when predicting
    -   More representative features
-   Expand evaluation of privilege
    -   Rural vs urban/suburban; Education level
    -   AUD severity
    -   Intersectional analyses
    -   Fairness in treatment/support recommendations

# Methods

## Participants

-   N = 151
-   Early remission from Alcohol Use Disorder
-   Endorsed abstinence goal


## Procedure

-   Personal sensing via smartphone for up to 3 months
-   4x daily (craving, affect, efficacy, risky situations, stressful events, pleasant events)
-   Self-reported lapses back to alcohol use


## Sensitive Attributes

-   **Race/Ethnicity**: Non-hispanic White vs. People of Color
-   **Sex**: Male vs. Female
-   **Income**: above 50% of median personal income in Madison (\$15k) vs. below
-   **Age**: 55 or younger vs. above 55

## Machine Learning Model

-   XGBoost classification model
-   Features based on previous EMA
-   Provides hour-by-hour probability for future (next 24 hour) lapse


## Statistical Analysis

-   Compared groups (priviledged vs. unpriviledged) on two aggregate (auROC; auPR) and three specific (specificity, sensitivity, postive preditive value) peformance metrics
-   30 held-out performance estimates (from nested k-fold cross validation) for each metric
-   Posterior probabilities of group differences estimated using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models
